BANK KREAT

This remote repository was created from Bank Kreat project, an interest calculator with Sign Up functionality and validation modules. Go and simulate your investments!

This project gives you the chance to simulate your investments based on calculating compound interest for a determined period of time. As Albert Einstein said once: “Compound interest is the eighth wonder of the world. He who understands it, earns it; he who doesn't, pays it”. So it is basically an interface you can interact with setting different parameters, such as an initial investment, an annual bank interest, a period of time and a monthly reinvestment mount. Thus, calculator returns the profit that you earn in the specified period of time in months, and the total capital after the whole arithmetic operation.
